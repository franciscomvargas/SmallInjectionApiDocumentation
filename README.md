# API Documentation for SpeedCalculationAPI and UserInterface DTOs

This repository contains the OpenAPI specification and static documentation for selected API DTOs related to SpeedCalculation and UserInterface.

## What’s included?

- **swagger.yaml** — The OpenAPI (Swagger) specification defining the API endpoints and schemas, focused on SpeedCalculationDtos and UserInterfaceDtos only (other internal DTOs excluded for confidentiality).
- **smallInjectionAPI.html** — A static, standalone HTML documentation page generated using Redoc CLI for easy sharing and browsing.
- **Documentation strategy** — We chose Redoc for clean UI and support for deep linking between endpoints.
- **Hosted on GitHub Pages** — The static docs are designed to be published via GitHub Pages for simple and secure client access.
